# Set up permissions for non root users to open the Logitech Spotlight USB Receiver
# Enables the Projecteur application to access the device.

# Copy this file to /etc/udev/rules.d/55-spotlight.rules and replace 'spotlight-device'
# with a group your user is a member in. 
#
# Existing groups like 'plugdev' and 'dialout' can be used, but the `install` target
# uses a group called 'spotlight-device' by default. 
# Linux packages created with the 'dist-package' target will create this group if not
# present during installation.
#
# Run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` and `sudo udevadm trigger`
# to load rules without rebooting.

# Note that for kernels before 2.6.24, you will need to substitute "usb" with "usb_device".
